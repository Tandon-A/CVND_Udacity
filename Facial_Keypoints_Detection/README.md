# Facial Keypoints Detection 

Facial keypoints refer to the points of 'interest' in a human face. The corners of eyes and corners of the mouth are some examples of such vital points. 

As denoted by the dots in the image below, they help identify different parts of the face.

This project aims to build a CNN model to detect facial keypoints in an image. 

This detection allows building applications which manipulate facial images, for example, by adding artefacts to the image at desired locations. As shown in the picture below, the starting and ending point of the lip region allows one to put a moustache over the image.

Changing facial appearance is just one application. Accurate detection of facial keypoints can be used to build applications to recognize emotions or to create a  3d virtual character.
