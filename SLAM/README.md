# Landmark Detection and Tracking (SLAM) 

The goal of this project is to do landmark detection and tracking by using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a 2D world. For this, I have implemented [graphSLAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLEbJZFm5-E).

###### Fig 1: Final location of the robot found using SLAM

Using the robot's sensor measurements, SLAM predicts the position of the robot and the landmarks in the world. Localizing the robot in real-time builds a map of the environment.

## Applications

SLAM can be used to build environment map in case of all self-driving cars and drones. Augmented reality (AR) products use SLAM and then overlay digital interactions on the generated map.
