## [Project 1: Facial Keypoints Detection](https://github.com/Tandon-A/CVND_Udacity/tree/master/Facial_Keypoints_Detection)

This project aims to build a CNN model to detect facial keypoints in an image which are the points of 'interest' in a human face such as the corners of eyes and mouth. 
 
The detection of facial keypoints allows building facial image manipulation applications.

## [Project 2: Image Captioning](https://github.com/Tandon-A/CVND_Udacity/tree/master/Image_Captioning)

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model to generate captions for images. This is done using a CNN - RNN architecture following the paper [Show and Tell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).

Image captioning can be used to provide verbal descriptions to partially/complete visually impaired people through a headset. It can also be used to build a query based image search engine without the need of manually annotated images. 

Some sample captions generated by the trained model are shown below.
