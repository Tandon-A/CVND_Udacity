## [Project 1: Facial Keypoints Detection](https://github.com/Tandon-A/CVND_Udacity/tree/master/Facial_Keypoints_Detection)

This project aims to build a CNN model to detect facial keypoints in an image which are the points of 'interest' in a human face such as the corners of eyes and mouth. 
 
The detection of facial keypoints allows building facial image manipulation applications.
